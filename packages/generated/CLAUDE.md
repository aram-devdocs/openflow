# Generated Package

## Purpose

Contains auto-generated TypeScript types from Rust source. This is read-only code - never edit manually.

## Generation Source

Types come from Rust crates via typeshare. Run generators after modifying Rust types to keep in sync.

## Usage

Import types for function signatures, interfaces, and type annotations. These are the source of truth for API contracts.

## Never Edit

If types need to change, modify the Rust source and regenerate. Manual edits will be overwritten and cause drift.

## Validation

The type-staleness validator ensures generated types stay in sync with Rust. It fails if types are older than source.
