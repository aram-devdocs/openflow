# Molecules

## Purpose

Compositions of atoms that form functional UI groups. Molecules are still reusable but more specific than atoms.

## Composition

Import from atoms only. Compose multiple atoms into meaningful groups.

## Functionality

Molecules often handle local UI state (open/closed, focused, hover). They remain stateless regarding data.

## Props

Accept data and callbacks as props. Don't fetch or mutate data.

## Examples

Form fields (label + input + error), menu items, card headers, search bars.
