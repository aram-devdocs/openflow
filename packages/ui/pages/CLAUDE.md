# Pages

## Purpose

Full page compositions that combine templates with organisms. Pages are complete UI states.

## Composition

Use templates for layout, fill with organisms. This is the top of the UI hierarchy.

## Still Stateless

Even page components are stateless. Data comes from route components that use hooks.

## States

Each page handles loading, error, and empty states. Use consistent patterns.

## Examples

Project list page, task detail page, settings page, dashboard page.
