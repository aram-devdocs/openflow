# Organisms

## Purpose

Complex UI sections that combine molecules into distinct page areas. Organisms have specific roles.

## Composition

Import from molecules and atoms. Compose into complete functional sections.

## Complexity

Organisms can manage more local state for UI behavior (expanded panels, selected tabs). Still stateless for data.

## Props

Accept structured data objects and callback handlers. Props interface can be more complex.

## Examples

Navigation bars, sidebars, data tables, form sections, card lists.
