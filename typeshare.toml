# This configuration controls how Rust types are converted to TypeScript.

# Type mappings for custom types
# Map Rust types to TypeScript types when needed

[typescript.type_mappings]
# DateTime types - using ISO 8601 strings

"DateTime" = "string"
"NaiveDateTime" = "string"

# UUID - using string representation
"Uuid" = "string"

# Duration types
"Duration" = "number"

# Integer types - TypeScript uses number for all numeric types
"i64" = "number"
"u64" = "number"

# Path types - using string representation
"PathBuf" = "string"
"Path" = "string"

# JSON value types - using unknown for arbitrary JSON
